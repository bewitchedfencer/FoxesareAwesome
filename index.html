        <h1>Foxes are Awesome</h1>
        <p>The fox is known to be a cross between a cat and a dog. Domestication of foxes has not been popular since the 1300s, when they realized humans wore them as coats</p>

        <p>Foxes come in many shapes and colors. Most fall within the twelve species that are considered 'true foxes'. Those outside of these twelve species are considered faux foxes. Furriers refuse to use these faux fox furs because of the low prices they bring on the market.</p>
        <p>The arctic fox is the most vicious fox. It can take down a polar bear by itself. It can stare into the void of the arctic desert and stay sane.</p>
